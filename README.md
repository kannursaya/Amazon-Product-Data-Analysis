# **Amazon Product Data Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes an **Amazon product dataset**, uncovering insights into product pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer reviews. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize trends to better understand consumer behavior.  

## **Dataset Features** 

The dataset contains the following key attributes:  

- 🆔 **product_id, user_id, review_id** – Unique identifiers
- 
- 🏷️ **product_name, category** – Product details
- 
- 💰 **actual_price, discounted_price, discount_percentage** – Pricing information
- 
- ⭐ **rating, rating_count** – Customer feedback
- 
- 📝 **review_title, review_content** – User reviews
- 
- 🔗 **img_link, product_link** – Product images and links  

## **Key Analysis & Visualizations**  

✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, converting data types  

✔ **Price & Discount Analysis** – Understanding price trends and discount patterns  

✔ **Top-rated & Most-reviewed Products** – Identifying popular products  

✔ **Category-wise Analysis** – Finding top-performing categories  

✔ **Sentiment Analysis on Reviews** (Optional)
